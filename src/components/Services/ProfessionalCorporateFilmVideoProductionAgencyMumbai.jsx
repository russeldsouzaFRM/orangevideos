                  <p>
                    <Link to="/portfolio">Corporate video</Link> refers to any
                    type of non-advertisement based video created for and
                    commissioned by businesses or brands. Corporate videos help
                    sell ideas, products and services and are targeted at the
                    company’s core buyers or internal employees.{" "}

                  </h3>
                  <p>
                    Most often, corporate videos are used to promote and raise
                    awareness of a company’s brand as a whole, or to sell the
                    company’s offerings. Yet, corporate videos can serve many
                    different purposes:
                  </p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>1) Training &amp; instruction</li>

                    <li>5) Client and customer testimonials</li>
                    <li>6) Interviews of company leadership</li>
                    <li>7) Company introduction to potential clients</li>
                  </ul>

                  <p>
                    It is a corporate communication tool that includes a vast
                    amount of creativity through the use of storytelling, an
                    engaging message and a professional production.{" "}

                  <p>
                    A corporate video typically involves the following stages of
                    production.
                  </p>

                      action) footage is edited together. This may also include
                      recording an audio voice-over, adding graphics, composing
                      a music score or soundtrack, and including 2D/3D animation
                      sequences with the finished video.{" "}

                  <h3>
                    <strong>What makes a good corporate video?</strong>
                  </h3>
                  <p>
                    A good video requires good content. With the right content,
                    a quality corporate video production agency like Orange
                    Videos can create an engaging video even on a modest budget.{" "}
                  </p>

                  <h3>The ideal video length</h3>
                  <p>
                    Short is sweet when it comes to video length. A general rule
                    is to keep it under 3 minutes. 1-3 minutes is the ideal
                    timeline.{" "}
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Viewers generally check the duration of the video before
                    beginning to watch it. Hence, it is important that they are
                    interested during the video’s whole running time.{" "}
                  </p>

                  <h3>A call to action</h3>
                  <p>
                    A video’s call to action (CTA) directs the viewer to visit a
                    specific place, such as the company’s phone number or the
                    website. A call to action is a way to convert leads from
                    your corporate video.{" "}
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Businesses videos need to have a CTA to encourage the
                    audience whose interest is piqued to take further action.
                    The CTA has a greater impact if used when the viewer reaches
                    the end of the video.
                  </p>

                  <h3>Don’t Sell. Help them Buy.</h3>
                  <p>
                    Not every piece of content created by a company need not
                    scream ‘sell’. Especially not a corporate video. Unless you
                    are creating a sales or promotional video, other kinds of
                    videos need not have any sales messaging.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    This is because you don’t want the people who love your
                    video to get put off by the hint of sales. A sales message
                    is a distraction in an otherwise engaging video.{" "}
                  </p>

                  <h3>A strong message</h3>
                  <p>
                    Corporate videos are made with a purpose and an objective.
                    They must communicate a strong message to elicit the desired
                    response from the target audience. A strong message doesn’t
                    necessarily have to be awe-inspiring or larger than life.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    It has to be simple and convey the gist of the central
                    message. For instance, a video about culture needs to talk
                    about people, show people and make the communication
                    relatable to the viewer.{" "}
                  </p>

                  <h3>An emotional connection</h3>
                  <p>
                    Most corporate videos recite facts, figures, features and
                    benefits. Yet these are exactly the things that make the
                    viewer turn away from such content. While this may be good
                    information, it is analytical and boring.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Purchase decisions are typically emotional decisions. Videos
                    that seek to make a deeper connection with the target
                    audience and tell them exactly how the products and services
                    you offer affect their lives connect on an emotional level.
                  </p>
