                    <strong>What is an explainer video?</strong>
                  </h3>

                  <p>
                    An explainer video can be described as a short-form video
                    used to explain or introduce a product or service or
                    communicate a brand’s desired message to the target
                    audience. Through explainer videos, brands or businesses
                    educate their audience, create awareness, and eventually
                    persuade them to take an action in the end. Moreover, it
                    amplifies branding and marketing efforts by providing
                    solutions and creating a connection with the target
                    audience.{" "}
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    2D animated videos are commonly used for creating animated
                    movies, marketing videos, explainer videos, advertisements,
                    websites, etc. They help brands connect with their audience
                    and engage them by simplifying the brand’s desired message
                    or a process.
                  </p>

                  <h3>
                    <strong>What does an explainer video include?</strong>
                  </h3>
                  <p>
                    To create an effective explainer video, a brand or a video
                    team must include these five essential aspects as mentioned
                    below:{" "}
                  </p>
                  <p>1) Video length</p>
                  <p>
                    The shorter the video the better! An explainer video must be
                    created in under 3 minutes, as they work best and give
                    better results.{" "}
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The average attention span of a human being is 8 seconds
                    which is less than that of a goldfish, therefore, keeping
                    videos short, engaging, and impactful is crucial.
                  </p>

                  <p>2) Gives solution</p>
                  <p>
                    Explainer videos often address the audience’s pain points
                    and problems and provide solutions by educating them about
                    the products or services. This way, the audience has
                    something to gain from the video while getting hooked onto
                    them.{" "}
                  </p>

                  <p>3) Speaks to audience </p>
                  <p>
                    Explainer videos are a part of a brand’s marketing, thus
                    they must match the brand’s voice and speak the language of
                    the target audience in order to connect with them. If the
                    tonality and style of a video don’t relate to the audience,
                    then it will fail to engage them.
                  </p>

                  <p>4) High quality</p>
                  <p>
                    The overall quality of the video can make it or break it for
                    a brand. From the quality of the production to its script to
                    its sound effects, each aspect contributes to creating an
                    amazing video that effectively communicates the message.{" "}
                  </p>

                  <p>5) A strong call to action </p>
                  <p>
                    A strong call to action at the end of the video will clearly
                    state the next action to be taken by the target audience. It
                    is equally important as it results in receiving business
                    leads for a brand. Many businesses fail to achieve their
                    marketing goals because they focus more on promoting their
                    products or services and fail to compel the audience to take
                    any action.
                  </p>

                  <h3>
                    <strong>Types of explainer videos</strong>
                  </h3>
                  <p>
                    There are a few types of explainer videos that are commonly
                    used in the industry, like:
                  </p>
                  <p>1) Animated Explainer Video:</p>
                  <p>
                    Animated explainer videos are the go-to option when the
                    primary goal of creating a video is to explain a complex
                    idea or a process to the audience. Due to its visual appeal
                    and relative ease to create videos, it’s a popular choice
                    among brands. The educational format of an animated
                    explainer video makes it look interesting and attracts the
                    audience’s attention as compared to a person standing in
                    front of the camera and just spitting out words.{" "}
                  </p>

                  <p>2) Live-Action Explainer Video:</p>
                  <p>
                    This type of explainer video features people and objects to
                    explain a business’s products and services. It is quite
                    challenging to master it but it works great when done
                    properly. Unlike the animated explainer videos that use
                    interesting visuals to translate the message, live-action
                    explainer videos require creativity to keep the audience
                    engaged. Generally, the video shows a spokesperson from a
                    company who walks through the visual journey to effectively
                    communicate information about a product or service.{" "}
                  </p>

                  <p>3) Crowdfunding Explainer Video:</p>
                  <p>
                    Crowdfunding explainer videos can be both live-action and
                    animated videos or a combination of both. The length of the
                    videos is usually longer and more explanatory as it usually
                    explains how the funds are planned to be spent. An effective
                    crowdfunding explainer video can create a great impact among
                    the audience and result in raising hundreds and thousands of
                    rupees.{" "}

                  <h3>
                    <strong>The benefits of explainer videos</strong>
                  </h3>
                  <p>1) Builds trust and credibility</p>
                  <p>
                    Without building trust and credibility, customers will not
                    be open to knowing a brand’s product or services. Explainer
                    videos are a great way to reach out to customers. It shows
                    them that the brand cares for the customers by simplifying
                    an idea or a process for them, which further creates
                    engagement.

                    leads customers to take the desired action. It could be
                    buying a product, subscribing to emails, booking an
                    appointment, etc. Such videos also help customers to know
                    what they are getting into by providing information about
                    products or services, and more.{" "}
                  </p>

                    Additionally, videos also work great in email marketing. By
                    adding an explainer video in the subject line, it can boost
                    open rates and click-through rates by 19% and 65%
                    respectively.{" "}

                    engagement rate and the time spent by users on the website.
                    Videos embedded on the website engage users for a longer
                    time and decrease bounce rate. Including videos on the
                    website is a great practice to improve SEO ranking.{" "}

                  <p>4) Boosts social media reach </p>
                  <p>
                    Videos have become the most popular and engaging format on
                    social media platforms. Explainer videos help a company
                    reach a wider audience and connect with the intended
                    audience.{" "}
                  </p>

                    Customers always connect to those brands that show emotions,
                    and values and present themselves as more than a mere

                    Explainer videos are created in the same way as any other

                  <p>
                    The production stage is where the animation begins or the
                    shooting of the explainer videos.{" "}

                  <p>
                    It involves editing and compiling all components of the
                    video and bringing it together. The addition of voice-over,
                    overlaying of music and sound effects is also done in the
                    final stage.

                    <strong>The benefits of explainer videos</strong>
                  </h3>
                  <p>1) Begin with a problem</p>
                  <p>
                    Starting the video by addressing customer’s problems and
                    pain points is the easiest and most effective way to grab
                    their attention. Customers are not interested to know about
                    random products or services that don’t connect with them or
                    serve as useful. Moreover, a customer is exposed to or
                    rather bombarded with several types of marketing activities
                    on a daily basis.{" "}
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Therefore, providing a solution or fixing a problem appeals
                    more to the customer and facilitates the creation of a
                    connection between a brand and the customer.{" "}
                  </p>

                  <p>2) Focus on benefits not features</p>
                  <p>
                    Brands must think about the customer and as the customer.
                    While a company may have pioneering technology or a unique
                    selling proposition that makes them stand out in the market,
                    customers will always look for benefits and care less about
                    the features and its technicality. A company should be
                    direct and to the point while stating how its product or
                    services will make a customer’s life or work easy within a
                    short span of time.{" "}
                  </p>

                  <p>3) Make it customer-centric</p>
                  <p>
                    Understand and research what the customers actually need and
                    use them to engage the audience. Speak the language that
                    they understand the best, and use the correct tonality and
                    style that they would relate to. Explainer videos should be
                    customer-focused rather than brand-focused.{" "}
                  </p>

                  <p>4) Focus on audio quality</p>
                  <p>
                    The audio of a video holds the same significance as the
                    visuals of the video. Without proper audio, high quality,
                    and correct timing, an explainer video could end up as a
                    disaster! Audio elements such as sound effects, voiceovers,

                    Explainer videos are an investment that ensures returns
                    along with an entertainment value. Additionally, the video
                    could be repurposed into different formats for different
                    digital marketing platforms to amplify a company’s marketing
                    efforts.{" "}

                    Explainer videos are visually appealing, attractive, and
                    entertaining. They may look simple, however, creating them
                    requires a certain skill set that takes years of practice to
                    master. Explainer videos can benefit your company in more
                    than one way and can create a high level of recall value and
                    impression among customers’ minds.{" "}

                    There are a few software options that allow users to create
                    DIY animated videos, but when it comes to your brand
                    reputation and marketing goals, it's best to leave the work
                    to professionals.{" "}
