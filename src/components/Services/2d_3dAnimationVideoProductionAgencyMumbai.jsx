                    <strong>What is a 2D animated video? </strong>
                  </h3>

                  <p>
                    A 2D animated video uses two-dimensional motion images,
                    meaning the objects and figures in the video have height and
                    width but no volume. The objects and figures used in the
                    video look like flat images.{" "}
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    2D animated videos are commonly used for creating animated
                    movies, marketing videos, explainer videos, advertisements,
                    websites, etc. They help brands connect with their audience
                    and engage them by simplifying the brand’s desired message
                    or a process.

                  </h3>
                  <p>
                    Businesses across industries prefer 2D animation videos to
                    improve brand awareness and introduce products or services
                    to the target audience. An ideal 2D animation video involves
                    a vibrant colour scheme, amazing character animations, and
                    impactful messaging that has a great recall value to
                    persuade the audience.{" "}
                  </p>

                  <h3>
                    <strong>How are 2D animated videos created? </strong>
                  </h3>
                  <p>
                    The process of creating 2D animated videos is divided into
                    three parts:
                  </p>
                  <p>1) Pre-Production </p>
                  <p>
                    The first stage of the process involves writers and
                    animators working together and deciding on the story, flow,
                    and script of the animation. The team then designs the
                    characters, chalks out the storyboard, and selects the
                    colour theme and the background for the video.{" "}
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    While working on the script, the writer ensures that the
                    script guides and directs the visual action and the
                    storyline in the video, thus giving more clarity to the
                    sequence of events in the video.{" "}
                  </p>

                  <p>2) Pre-Production </p>
                  <p>
                    In the production stage, the elements created during the
                    pre-production of the video are brought together to produce
                    and work on the animated scenes. This process includes
                    animating the characters, designing scenes, and adding
                    colours to the background along with making some rough
                    animations. In short, during production, the team brings the
                    characters, elements, and story to life, step-by-step.{" "}
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    To perfect the job and make the animation look smooth,
                    tracing and in-betweening processes are used in the video.
                    Tracing is used to clean up the rough animation on an
                    animation layer or on the same layer with different colours.
                    Whereas, in-betweening is used to add more transitional
                    frames between mainframes so that it looks more natural and
                    seamless.
                  </p>

                  <p>3) Post-Production </p>
                  <p>
                    During the final stage of creating 2D animated videos, the
                    team carries out the final editing and enhances the final
                    product. This phase ensures that the final video
                    successfully translates the desired message, creates an
                    impact in the audience’s mind, and engages them with the
                    content with correct sound effects and frame lengths.{" "}
                  </p>

                    <strong>Tools to create 2D animated videos</strong>
                  </h3>
                  <p>
                    An animated video published by a brand also represents its
                    stature and the standards of its communication and marketing
                    efforts in the market. Thus, creating a low-quality video
                    with a lack of clear messaging can do more harm than good.{" "}

                    In order to create successful 2D &amp; 3D animated videos
                    that people remember, the use of effective tools becomes
                    imperative to achieve the goal. Here are some of the common
                    tools that designers and animators use in the industry:{" "}
                  </p>
                  <p>For Animation: </p>
                  <ul>

                  </ul>

                  <h3>
                    <strong>What is a 3D animated video? </strong>
                  </h3>
                  <p>
                    In 3D animated videos, computer-generated figures and
                    objects are brought to life by utilising motion in
                    three-dimensional space. 3D animation allows subjects to
                    move and rotate, giving a real-life experience in a digital
                    environment.{" "}
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    It is central to an array of industries such as gaming,
                    movies, virtual reality, and TV shows among others.
                    Moreover, with the help of 3D software, many industries also
                    use it to design and develop products, for presentations and
                    marketing purposes, and more.
                  </p>

                  <p>The process of 3D animation </p>
                  <p>1) Concept and Storyboards </p>
                  <p>
                    Similar to 2D Animation, the process of 3D animation begins
                    with planning, conceptualisation of ideas, and creation of
                    storyboards that guides the team to visually present the
                    story or an idea in the video.{" "}
                  </p>

                  <p>2) Modelling </p>
                  <p>
                    Modelling is all about taking a shape and moulding it into a
                    3D mesh. One of the common ways to do it is by taking a
                    simple object, and creating a shape out of it that can be
                    refined and detailed.
                  </p>

                  <p>3) Layout &amp; Animation</p>
                  <p>
                    In the third stage, the animation process is initiated. The
                    selected 3D object is made to move in different ways, either
                    using keyframes—moving the object on a frame-by-frame
                    basis—to using motion capture data.
                  </p>

                  <p>4) Rendering</p>
                  <p>
                    The animator proceeds to render the 3D character when the
                    animation, lighting, and camera angles are finalised. The
                    process of rendering mainly involves creating and exporting
                    the designed graphic images and making final changes to the
                    3D character as per the light and shadows, reflections,
                    transparency, etc.
                  </p>

                  <p>The benefits of using 3D animated videos</p>
                  <p>1) Attracts audience attention </p>
                  <p>
                    Due to its universal appeal, 3D animation attracts the
                    audience’s attention and creates a great impact on their
                    minds.{" "}
                  </p>

                  <p>2) Promotes engagement </p>
                  <p>
                    Businesses often opt for animation to engage with their
                    audience. With the help of unique concepts and visual
                    appeal, 3D animated videos help brands to create connections
                    with their audience.{" "}
                  </p>

                  <p>3) Creates branding </p>
                  <p>
                    3D animation is one of the proven effective tools for
                    branding. An ideal 3D animated video leaves an impression on
                    customers’ minds and further amplifies the brand’s
                    uniqueness in the market.{" "}
                  </p>

                  <p>4) Attracts online traffic</p>
                  <p>
                    Besides the high demand and consumption of videos by the
                    audience in their daily life, animated videos work great on
                    different digital platforms. This gives high chances for a
                    brand to get explored by their targeted audiences. In
                    addition, a study shows that incorporating videos on a
                    landing page can significantly increase conversions by 80%.{" "}
