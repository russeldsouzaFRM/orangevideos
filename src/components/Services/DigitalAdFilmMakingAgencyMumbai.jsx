                    <strong>What is a digital video commercial?</strong>
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    A video commercial is an advertisement promoting a brand’s
                    product or service on digital media. Such videos raise brand
                    awareness, acquire new leads, and help increase customer
                    retention and conversion. These videos are meant for digital
                    channels like websites, social media and mobile apps.{" "}

                    <strong>Why are DVCs popular?</strong>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    With the proliferation of digital marketing, it has become
                    imperative that brands create meaningful and engaging
                    content on digital media to interest, engage and grow their
                    customers. They help you turn viewers into customers, on any
                    budget. DVCs can get more purchases, subscribers, website
                    visits and more.
                  </p>
                  <p>There are 5 types of digital video ads: </p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>YouTube Ads</li>
                    <li>Facebook and Instagram Video Ads</li>
                    <li>LinkedIn Video Ads</li>
                    <li>Ads on OTT and Streaming Services</li>
                    <li>Native Video Ads on your website</li>
                  </ul>

                  <p>
                    It is a corporate communication tool that includes a vast
                    amount of creativity through the use of storytelling, an
                    engaging message and a professional production.{" "}

                    <strong>How to create DVCs?</strong>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    DVCs are popular because they are not always difficult or
                    expensive, and all kinds of production styles, tools and
                    techniques can work. In fact, a simple video shot on a phone
                    might be the best way to showcase what makes your business
                    unique.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Brands engage professional video production agencies like
                    Orange Videos to create superior quality digital video
                    commercials that share the right message, in the most
                    engaging style to the right audience.

                    <strong>Steps involved in making a DVC:</strong>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    A video commercial is a short hook to get the audience’s
                    interest piqued about your product or service. Making it
                    effective requires:
                  </p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      A script - choose the right tone, language and punchline.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Find the right voice and / or music to make it click
                    </li>
                    <li>Select the right style - live action or animation</li>
                    <li>Let the production quality come through</li>
                    <li>Keep it simple and sweet</li>
                  </ul>

                  <p>
                    <strong>How to create a great DVC?</strong>
                  </p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      Make the first few seconds count - Most DVCs are usually
                      shorter than 15 seconds. Which means every second counts.
                      The first few seconds should hook the audience and tempt
                      them to keep watching till they reach the CTA.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Highlight what makes your brand great - the key features
                      and the key benefits only. The lesser, the better. Great
                      ads focus on one aspect only - a new feature, reduced
                      price, great offer. Don’t turn the ad into a boring
                      explainer video.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Use a call to action - the CTA is the action you want the
                      audience to take. Good ads always have a goal - app
                      download, buy now, donate - it can either be filmed,
                      voiced or added through graphics and text animation.
                    </li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>
                    DVCs are a great way to engage your audience in a
                    cost-effective manner. Whether your goal is to increase
                    sales, or brand recognition, you’ll find digital video
                    marketing to be a great addition to your strategy.
