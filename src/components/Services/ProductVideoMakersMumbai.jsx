                  <p>
                    A product video is an explainer video that demonstrates the
                    features, the benefits and the workings of a product. A good
                    product video does not just focus on the features of the
                    product but also talks about the pain points that it solves
                    for the customer. It makes its benefits clear and builds
                    trust towards your brand, which drives sales.

                    If you have a physical product like machinery or an
                    electronic equipment or even a software, a video
                    communicates how it works in the real world. SaaS companies,
                    medical device manufacturers, industrial equipment makers -
                    almost anyone with a tangible or intangible product can
                    benefit from a video. Our product videos successfully
                    explain the new offerings in a way that consumers can
                    quickly comprehend, giving them a reason to be interested.

                    Physical products can be shot on camera in action. They are
                    great for products that have attractive packaging or
                    physical attributes that are best explained and better
                    trusted if the way they work is actually shown on film.

                    Complex products can be shown through 2D or 3D animation.
                    Because the animation is created gradually, while the
                    explanation develops, it is a super-educational approach,
                    ideal for hard-to-explain products or services.

                    Product videos are typically placed at the bottom of the
                    sales funnel - in the decision making stage. Product videos
                    are meant to showcase the features of what you can offer and
                    close the deal. A good product video will convince the
                    hesitant buyer to try your solution.
