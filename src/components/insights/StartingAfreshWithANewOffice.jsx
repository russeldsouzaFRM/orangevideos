                    The un-lockdown phase has transformed the experience of work
                    life. Coming back to the office, a lot more has changed
                    besides the breakthrough of monotony. With less traffic on
                    the roads and switching to private commutes as a part of
                    safety, thereâ€™s now room for leisure activities, coming back
                    home. Travelling to the office is a lot less stressful now
                    and we, at Futuready Media took this opportunity to make it
                    something to look up to as well by moving into a brand-new
                    office! With the new year approaching, we leveled-up to
                    generate better and brighter ideas for our clients by
                    growing the space for our growing team!
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Our new office got pampered with a welcoming puja and a
                    renewed enthusiasm from our side to drive our agency towards
                    prosperity and success. The new office reflects our agency
                    perfectly - it's elegant, bright, spacious, and well
                    accommodated with a lounge to unwind or brainstorm ideas,
                    potted plants and eye-catchy paintings, a coffee machine to
                    let the aroma of coffee mingle around us, and of course, a
                    bottle of sanitizer on the working desk to kick-out germs!
                    We also have a large terrace area where we bond and
                    de-stress by playing football, trying out hoverboarding or
                    just conversing with our close colleagues. An open space
                    leads to an open mind a.k.a better ideas!
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Keeping the safety of our teammates in mind and also making
                    the change more gradual for them, each of us began visiting
                    the office only once a week. Let's get to know their
                    experience coming back to the office, that too a new one.{" "}

                    Smita Sahu, our Content Manager shares, "During the lockdown
                    phase, I had gotten quite comfortable working from home. I
                    hesitated to step out, but with my supportive colleagues
                    around, I quickly gelled into the new setup and began
                    looking forward to the office days."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Karen, our Creative Head exclaims, "Getting a chance to
                    personalize our new office was something really exciting for
                    me. I actively participated in it and thoroughly enjoyed it
                    as well."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Somshekhar mentions, "Coming back to the office, that too a
                    new one, perfect! I got a much-needed kickstart in my work
                    life which positively impacted other areas of my life too.
                    The modern space is a perfect fit for our agency!"
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Prateek says, "I welcomed the change wholeheartedly and
                    adapted quickly. Honestly, I was missing the morning hustle
                    to the office and the group brainstorming sessions!"
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Rachna recollects, "The transition into the new office was
                    overwhelming but also refreshing. I would like to use this
                    chance to appreciate the coffee machine that's there - a cup
                    of coffee sets the day!"
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    With this little sneak-peek into our new office, we welcome
                    you to the place where we blend creativity with technology
                    to revolutionize digital marketing for brands.
