                How Much Does A Corporate Video Cost?

                    A corporate video has many factors that affect its cost. It
                    varies from the type of video, length, timelines etc. Here
                    are a few of them that determine the video production cost.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    <strong>Style of the video:</strong>
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    This is one of the most important factors that determines
                    the cost of a video.
                    <a href="https://www.orangevideos.in/2d-3d-animation-video-production-agency-mumbai">
                      3d Animation Video
                    </a>{" "}
                    would cost more than a 2D animation video/explainer video. A
                    2D video with more characters would cost less than a 2D
                    video with lesser characters. Live action videos have
                    different cost factors involved like location, equipment
                    needed etc.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    <strong>Length of the video:</strong>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The calculation here is simple. A longer video will have a
                    higher cost than a shorter one. A two-minute video literally
                    has twice as many scenes as one minute video.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    <strong>Timelines:</strong>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    A video requirement that is urgent and requires burning the
                    midnight oil will cost more than a video which has
                    reasonable fair timelines.
                  </p>
                  <p>There are other various additional costs based on:</p>

                  <p>
                    <strong>1) Script requirement:</strong>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    If your video requires a script, the video production agency
                    may get a professional script writer to work on the plot
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    <strong>2) Stock images/Videos:</strong>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Many videos require the use of stock photos and videos.
                    Purchasing them will add to the cost of your video
                    production.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    <strong>3) Stock images/Videos:</strong>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Voice artists charge according to their versatility and
                    experience. Also, the cost differs depending on the length
                    of the script. Also, a video that demands more than one
                    voice artist, will incur a higher cost.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    These are the basic factors most video production companies
                    consider before sharing the video production cost.
