                    From the minute you open your social media newsfeed to the
                    minute you check your notifications - you are bombarded with
                    ads calling for your attention. As a business owner, this is
                    a double-edged sword. Making an{" "}

                    that people will actually click on and sit through is
                    challenging, but achieving it isn’t impossible either. When
                    Symbo reached out to us for a video ad requirement, we
                    pulled up our socks, and bagged ourselves a deal for a 1:26
                    mins long ad film. Thus began our 3-month-long stint to make
                    the perfect ad film for Symbo.

                    Every second is precious for a viewer these days. You have
                    only a few seconds to make your video shine through before
                    they decide to skip your ad or continue watching it. At
                    Orange Videos, we believe that multiple revisions and
                    attention to detail during every second of the video are
                    non-negotiable to give a client a satisfactory ad film.
                    After understanding Symbo’s business model and holding a few
                    discussions with the clients, we arrived at the main idea
                    they wanted to communicate - The benefits and ease of having
                    a point of purchase insurance with Symbo.

                    Like in every pre-production phase, this phase of the
                    project began by finding the best way to communicate Symbo’s
                    message - humour. We also attribute this to the CGO of Symbo
                    - who happens to be a veteran improv artist during his
                    after-work hours. He invited our team to one of his improv
                    nights and impressed us with his acting and comic skills.
                    Before we could begin our hunt for actors, we found someone
                    who was willing and a perfect fit for the ad film. The CGO
                    played the part of the eyewear store customer in the ad
                    film, whereas the other improv comedian took the role of the
                    storekeeper. After the script was finalised and we were done
                    envisioning the ad film sequence through our storyboard
                    sketches, we started putting together the make-believe
                    eyewear store. The background store you blink through and
                    pay little heed to during the video is something that needed
                    logo designing, printing, set-up, and weeks of attention to
                    detail. A few days before the shoot day, the costumes that
                    were finalised got lost in a rather busy auto-ride. We had
                    to re-print the logos on the t-shirt and get a new jacket
                    that the buyer sports in the video. We encountered a handful
                    of similar curveballs but managed to sail through just fine
                    with new lessons and rigour.

                    The production day was the defining day of the entire ad
                    film project. The folks from Symbo and our team came geared
                    up to make the most of the one-day shoot. Our ad film
                    director was prepared to motivate and guide the crew to put
                    their best foot forward. After the actors were done getting
                    a makeover and the lighting and camera angles were set, the
                    director let out the lights, camera, action command. It took
                    multiple takes and scenes before the crew and the director
                    were satisfied with the final footage and the day came to an
                    end.

                    The most exciting part had finally begun in the
                    post-production phase. The footage and animation were
                    combined in a seamless transition. The first cut of the ad
                    film was too long, so we decided to cut it short after the
                    folks at Symbo agreed. We made the video more concise by
                    cutting down on some scenes and pacing up the transition.
                    The peppy music you hear in the background of Symbo’s ad is
                    not stock music, it was created by an instrumentalist we
                    hired after the final cut was ready. We also had another
                    surprising addition - a ghazal singer. He is the man behind
                    the alluring voice of Symbo’s ad film. You will be surprised
                    to know that the original voiceover was much slower and it
                    needed to be speed enhanced to 1.1x before being just right.{" "}

                    Alas, after 3 months of collaboration, creation and
                    revisions, we got the rewarding feeling of delivering the
                    perfect ad film to Symbo. Creating an ideal ad film is not a
                    one-man, one day task. Yet, the rewarding feeling and the
                    results that follow are worth it. Hit play to see the magic
                    we created for 1:26 mins. Caution: You won’t be able to hit
                    pause!
