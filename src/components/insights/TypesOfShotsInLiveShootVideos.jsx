                    Whenever we make a video, we consciously choose to select
                    the shots that would go into it. Every video we make at{" "}
                    <a href="https://www.orangevideos.in/">Orange Videos</a> has
                    several shots of different magnifications. Filmmakers
                    usually do this to lay emphasis on a particular subject,
                    thus helping achieve the desired narrative goal.{" "}
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Let’s have a look at the types of shots that we typically
                    use in our videos.
                  </p>

                  <ol>
                    <li>
                      <strong>Extreme Wide Shot:</strong>
                    </li>
                    <p>
                      This shot gives the audience an idea about the world where
                      the story takes place. Whether it’s a desert, a city or
                      outer space, the extreme wide shot is an essential tool
                      for world-building in narrative videos.{" "}
                    </p>

                    <li>
                      <strong>Wide/Long Shot:</strong>
                    </li>
                    <p>
                      A wide shot is often referred to as a long shot, it puts
                      the subject in context with the backdrop established in
                      the extreme wide shot. You can see the character from head
                      to toe and in relation to the location, they are in.{" "}
                    </p>

                    <li>
                      <strong>Two Shot</strong>
                    </li>
                    <p>
                      The two-shot, as the name suggests, is the shot with two
                      people in it. It is usually used to show two people in
                      conversation. This shot is often used to show romance,
                      conflict and action. It is the best way to get the
                      reactions of two characters in one shot.
                    </p>

                    <li>
                      <strong>Medium Shot</strong>
                    </li>
                    <p>
                      A medium shot, commonly referred to as a mid-shot, shows
                      the character from the waist up. It’s all about the
                      details. In this shot, one can get more detail than in a
                      wide shot. Medium shots are usually used in dialogue
                      scenes where the focus is on the character's body language
                      - whether they have crossed their arms when they talk or
                      they use a lot of hand gestures while talking about
                      something particular.{" "}
                    </p>

                    <li>
                      <strong>Medium close up</strong>
                    </li>
                    <p>
                      Right in between the close-up and the medium shot, the
                      medium close-up shows a character from the shoulders up.
                      This shot is used to give more detail about the character.
                      This shot is usually used with the character on the phone,
                      or eating something. A Medium close-up can be used to
                      build up to an emotional climax.{" "}
                    </p>

                    <li>
                      <strong>Close up</strong>
                    </li>
                    <p>
                      A close-up shot is used to frame a character’s face. It is
                      a more intimate shot to look into the character’s emotions
                      and mannerisms that the audience might miss in a medium
                      shot. A close-up need not be just of the face. A cutaway
                      like a foot-tapping, glasses falling, or water dripping
                      can be shown using a close-up shot.{" "}
                    </p>

                    <li>
                      <strong>Extreme Close-up</strong>
                    </li>
                    <p>
                      Extreme close-ups frame even tighter on the face (or the
                      subject), highlighting a specific feature. It usually
                      frames a particular part of the face like an eye or the
                      mouth. It is far more intimate than a normal close-up and
                      can emphasize the emotion that the actor is conveying.{" "}
                    </p>
                  </ol>

                  <p>
                    These are the shots that we use to create a shot list. These
                    shots are used to maximise the coverage i.e. to cover a
                    scene in as many shots as possible to make it easier for the
                    editor to cut. This is another creative way in which videos
                    can be made beautiful visually.{" "}
