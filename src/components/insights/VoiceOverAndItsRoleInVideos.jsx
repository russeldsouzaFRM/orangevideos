                    Most companies use videos as an advertising/marketing tool.
                    They are a great way to appeal to and attract your audience.
                    Video production companies always suggest including a
                    voice-over, as it adds value to a video.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    A Voice-over is the translation of the narrative script
                    recorded by voice artists. An appropriate voice must be
                    selected depending on the type of video and the target
                    audience.
                  </p>

                  <h2>There are many voice-over categories, like:</h2>

                  <ol>
                    <li>
                      <strong>Commercial voice-overs: </strong>These are voices
                      overs for radio, podcast ads, television, and online
                      videos. They generally centre around the character or the
                      spokesperson who is advertising a service/product to the
                      audience.
                    </li>

                      documentaries, e-learning videos and business training
                      materials. Here, the narrator takes the audience through a
                      story via animation or filmed footage.
                    </li>

                    <li>

                      voice narrations, PA systems (used at the airport) etc.
                      are used for communication.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                      <strong>Animation and gaming: </strong>Voice-overs used
                      here bring characters and stories to life.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                      <strong>Promos and trailers: </strong>Voice-overs are used
                      to advertise upcoming movies, television shows.

                  </ol>

                    <li>
                      <strong>Gives credibility to your video:</strong> Your
                      audience tends to develop a sense of trust in what they
                      hear and anticipate it when they see any audiovisual
                      piece.{" "}
                    </li>

                    <li>
                      <strong>Humanises your brand:</strong> You may want to
                      give your brand an approachable, friendly element, or a
                      professional and reliable quality. A good voice-over can
                      make your audience feel spoken to and deliver the message
                      to them very well.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                      <strong>Increases conversions:</strong> Most videos are
                      created for a commercial purpose like selling products and
                      services, training etc. Adding a voice-over to your video
                      can help increase conversions as audiences are more likely
                      convinced to buy a product that contains explanatory
                      information.{" "}
                    </li>

                    <li>
                      <strong>Improves customer service experience:</strong> If
                      your business uses videos to support and communicate with
                      customers, adding a voice-over in multiple languages will
                      help you reach a wider audience.{" "}
                    </li>

                    <li>
                      <strong>Brings your story to life:</strong> You are
                      actually telling a story every time you create a video or
                      an animation. For this story to attract your audience, you
                      need a voice-over with a perfect tone, pitch, and
                      inflexions.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                      <strong>Persuades to take necessary action:</strong> A
                      voice-over not only creates trust, but also encourages a
                      viewer to take the next action. Voice-overs can guide the
                      audience to take the next step like signing up for a free
                      trial, subscribing to a channel or buying the
                      product/service.{" "}

                    <li>
                      <strong></strong>Acts as a filler: Sometimes you may
                      choose for some aspects of your story to be narrated in a
                      voice-over rather than through visuals. It also allows you
                      to explain details that may be harder to express visually.{" "}
                    </li>
                  </ol>

                  <p>
